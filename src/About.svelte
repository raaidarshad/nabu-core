            We often find ourselves wondering how people can live in such entirely
            different realities. One commonly discussed idea is that of online
            "bubbles", where we only consume news from certain sources and only
            talk about it with like-minded people. These bubbles often reinforce
            our prior beliefs and further distance us from those in other
            bubbles. One small way to help bridge this gap is to simply be aware
            of the full spectrum of news available to us. We've tried doing this
            by following a variety of accounts on Twitter, but there is so much
            noise on that platform.

            In response, we made this super simple news dashboard. It is divided
            into five columns, ranging from one end of the political spectrum to
            the other (as defined by
            <a href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings"
                >AllSides research</a
            >). Each lane lists the top 10 news stories from an RSS feed of that
            news source, and you can click the headline to visit the source
            article to read further. You can also click on the news source name
            (try clicking on "Vox (Home)") to select a different news source.
            With this tool, you can get an idea of what news is disseminated
            across the political spectrum at a quick glance. In short, you can
            pop the bubble.
